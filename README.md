This was a challenge in Siraj Raval's video of Learn Python for Data Science -#1 Video Series.

The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

I used two classifiers:
1. Decision Tree
2. Guassian Naive Bayes 

I also used a function accuracy_score() to give us the accuracy of the classification model used towards the end of the model.
